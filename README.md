# Titanic Survivability Prediction Project
This repository contains the "Basic Classification" project which was created in July of 2022. <br> 
This machine learning program uses a kaggle dataset of passenger information from the Titanic. <br>
With this information, we were able to create machine learning models which would <br>
predict if someone would survive or die on the Titanic by analyzing their <br>
name, age, cabin placement, ticket price, and size of family onboard. <br>
